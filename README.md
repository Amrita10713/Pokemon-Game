**Pokémon Battle Simulator in Java: **
This project is a console-based Pokémon battle simulator developed in Java. 
The game allows users to choose a Pokémon from a selection of four iconic species (Pikachu, Charmander, Squirtle, and Bulbasaur) and engage in a turn-based battle against a randomly selected opponent. 
The game features a simple battle system, where each Pokémon takes turns attacking or healing, with the goal of defeating the opponent. 
The project demonstrates basic object-oriented programming concepts, such as classes, objects, and inheritance, as well as control structures and input/output operations in Java.
